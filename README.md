Diwali is one of the biggest shopping seasons, and understanding consumer behavior during this time can provide valuable business insights. In my latest Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, I analyzed Diwali sales data using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover key trends in customer purchases. 📊

🔍 Key Insights:

✅ Women aged 26-35 were the most frequent buyers, with higher purchasing power than men.

✅ Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka led in total sales and order volumes.

✅ Customers from IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors were top spenders.

✅ The most popular product categories? Food, Clothing, and Electronics!
